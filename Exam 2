Null: The coefficients for all levels of education are zero. (Income and Education)
Alternate: At least one of the education coefficients is not zero. (Income and Education)

Since the p-value was 2.2e-16, we can reject the null hypoethesis which suggests that coefficients for income and education are zero

Findings from the subset :
  
  The majority of individuals report no days of poor mental health (Median = 0), but the mean is higher (4.58 days), suggesting that a smaller group may experience a significant number of days with poor mental health.
  A significant portion of the population falls into the $50k - $75k income range (54,920 individuals), followed by the $100k - $150k range (48,686 individuals).
  A large portion of the population has completed college or more (174,447 individuals). This indicates that the dataset may have a high representation of individuals with higher education levels.
  The dataset includes individuals across different age ranges, with a notable representation of older age groups (ages 65-79) in the sample, suggesting that the data might be skewed towards an older demographic.

summary(ols_model)

I chose IncomeBracket, AGEBracket and Educ and the interaction between Income and Education. I would say that IncomeBracket and Educ are not exogenous but AgeBracket is because it doesn't seem to depend on MentalHealth or other variables. The interaction is showing us whether income affects mental health differently depending on the level of education.
For IncomeBracketHH income 15k - 20k:EducGrades 1 through 8 (Elementary):This interaction term is positive (0.134973).
It suggests that for people with only elementary education, having an income between 15k-20k is associated with a higher likelihood of reporting poor mental health. So, increasing income doesn't help as much for people with lower education.
For IncomeBracketHH income 100k - 150k:EducCollege 4 years or more (College graduate): This interaction term is positive (0.159681).
It indicates that for college graduates, higher income (100k - 150k) seems to have a positive effect on mental health. People with higher education and higher income are more likely to report fewer days of poor mental health.


4b) I would say the estimates seem plausible. For example : For IncomeBracketHH income 15k - 20k: The coefficient of -0.1875 suggests that people in this income bracket are less likely to report poor mental health than those in lower income brackets, which aligns with the general understanding that higher income can reduce mental health stress. For EducCollege 1 year to 3 years: The coefficient of 0.1343 suggests that individuals with some college or technical school experience are more likely to report poor mental health than those with lower education.
I would say that age and Income are the most statistically significat because their effects on mental health are unlikely to be due to chance.  (followed by education)  The interactions are not based on the output/data. Income's effect on mental health doesn't change much depending on education level.

predict <- function(income, educ, age, model) {

  predictdata <- data.frame(
    IncomeBracket = factor(income, levels = levels(brfss_sm$IncomeBracket)),
    Educ = factor(educ, levels = levels(brfss_sm$Educ)),
    AgeBracket = factor(age, levels = levels(brfss_sm$AgeBracket))
  )
  
 
  linear_pred <- predict(model, newdata = predictdata, type = "response")
  
  
  probability <- 1 / (1 + exp(-linear_pred))
  return(probability)
}


mid_prob <- predict_probability("HH income 50k - 75k", "Grade 12 or GED (High school graduate)", "Age 25 to 29", ols_model)
high_prob <- predict_probability("HH income 100k - 150k", "College 4 years or more (College graduate)", "Age 60 to 64", ols_model)
low_prob <- predict_probability("HH income 35k - 50k", "College 1 year to 3 years (Some college or technical school)", "Age 45 to 49", ols_model)


mid_prob
high_prob
low_prob

This means that there is a  60% chance that  the people in the 50k-75k range will report more than 3 days of poor mental health.
This means that there is a  54% chance that  the people in the 100k-150k range will report more than 3 days of poor mental health.
This means that there is a  59% chance that  the people in the 35k-50k range will report more than 3 days of poor mental health.

                   data = Logitsubset_data, 
                   family = binomial(link = "logit"))


summary(logit_model)



The predictors stayed the same with education, income and age as they have some impact on mentalhealth. Based on the data, only Age seems to be exogenous because it doesn't have a relationship with the other variables of the dataset.

5b)  The coefficient for IncomeBracketHH income 200k+ is -1.35208, indicating that individuals in this income bracket have a lower likelihood of reporting poor mental health compared to the baseline income group. These negative coefficients are consistent with expectations for the effect of income on mental health, so the estimates seem plausible.
       The coefficients for age categories are negative , indicating that older individuals are more likely to report poor mental health. This is plausible given the challenges older individuals may face.
The coefficients for education categories  are positive which does not seem plausible.

For income, education and age , all the p-values are less than 0.05 which means that it is statistically significant to mental health.
